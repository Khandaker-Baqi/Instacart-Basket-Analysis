# Instacart-Basket-Analysis
## An analysis of Instacart's order data to find patterns in customer behavior
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Despite having very good sales, they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The objective of this project is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they are considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. This analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
